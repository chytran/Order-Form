# Order-Form

This is a school assignment in which it displays a form of information that a user has to input for a specific item and send off to the company. The form will be sent, and the user will be returned their order results after sending the form in order to save for future references. There will be a seperate php file that will verify that there are no errors such as invalid prices or not matching the credit card number.
